Kuluta Malabar Which of the above pairs is/are correctly matched ?\n((a) 1 and 2 (b) 2 only (c) 1 and 3 (d) 3 only B ANSWER Explanation Kashmir had come into prominence in the seventh century, and through gradual expansion and conquest it controlled a major part of northern Punjab. Meanwhile the Arabs were advancing up the Indus valley, and in the eighth century a king of Kashmir asked for assistance from the Chinese to repel Arab attacks on the Punjab. The reign of Lalitaditya in the same century took the armies of Kashmir into the Ganges valley, and in the Punjab they pushed back the Arab forces. In subsequent centuries the kings of Kashmir consolidated their position in the mountainous areas and the upper Jhelum valley, leaving the Punjab to fend for itself. Many irrigation works were undertaken :\nembankments and dams were built on the main rivers a difficult engineering task since the rivers of Kashmir are the fast-flowing, unruly upper reaches of the Punjab rivers - and these brought a large area of the valley under cultivation, which was in effect a stabilizing factor in Kashmir politics since the need to move out into the fertile regions of the plains became less pressing. The foothills of the Himalayas lent themselves admirably to such small kingdoms, owing to the nature of the country. The ninth century saw the rise of a number of hill states, some of which main- tained their identity until recent years, despite their wars with each other and the frequent raids from the men of the plains. States such as Champaka (Chamba), Durgara (jammu), Trigarta (jalandhar), Kuluta (Kulu), Kumaon and Garhwal managed to remain outside the main areas of conflict in the northern plains. The oldest authentic historical reference to the hill states is to be found in the records of the Chinese pilgrim Hieun Tsang. 84 ZAN S K A R R U U Kilar K M C S h H U M (14328) a n A d r A x J (17045) a B (16722) S x .
