    "passage": "Passage - 1\nIn recent times, India has grown fast not only compared to its own past but also in comparison with other nations.\nBut there cannot be any room for complacency because it is possible for the Indian economy to develop even faster and also to spread the benefits of this growth more widely than has been done thus far.\nBefore going into details of the kinds of micro-structural changes that we need to conceptualize and then proceed to implemented, it is worthwhile elaborating on the idea of inclusive growth that constitutes the defining concept behind this Government's various economic policies and decisions.\nA nation interested in inclusive growth views the same growth differently depending on whether the gains of the growth are heaped primarily on a small segment or shared widely by the population.\nThe latter is cause for celebration but not the former.\nIn other words, growth must not be treated as an ends in itself but as an instrument for spreading prosperity to all.\nIndia's own past experience and the experience of other nations suggests that growth is necessary for eradicating poverty but it is not a sufficient condition.\nIn other words, policies for promoting growth need to be complemented with policies to ensure that more and more people join' in the growth process and, further, that there are mechanisms in place to redistributed some of the gains to those who are unable to partake in the market process and hence, get left behind.\nA simple way of giving this idea of inclusive growth a sharper form is to measure a nation's progress in terms of the progress of its poorest segment, for instance the bottom 20 per cent of the' population.\nOne could measure the per capita income of the bottom quintile of the population and also calculate the growth rate of income; and evaluate our economic success in terms of these measures that pertain to the poorest segment.\nThis approach is attractive because it does not ignore growth like some of the older heterodox criteria did.\nIt simply looks at the growth of income of the poorest sections of the population.\nIt also ensures that those who are outside of the bottom quintile do not get ignored.\nIf that were done, then those people would in all likelihood drop down into the bottom quintile and so would automatically become a direct target of our policies.\nHence the criterion being suggested here is a statistical summing up of the idea of inclusive growth, which, in turn, leads to two corollaries:\nto wish that India must strive to achieve high growth and that we must work to ensure that the weakest segments benefit from the growth.",

    "passage": "Passage - 2\nIt is essential that we mitigate the emissions of greenhouse gases and thus avoid some of the worst impact of climate change that would take place in coming years and decades.\nMitigation would require a major shift in the way we produce and consume energy.\nA shift away from overwhelming dependence on fossil fuels is now long overdue, but unfortunately, technological development has been slow arid inadequate largely because government policies have not promoted investments in research and development, myopically as a result of relatively low prices of oil.\nIt is now, therefore, imperative for a country like India treating the opportunity of harnessing renewable energy on a large scale as a national imperative.\nThis country is extremely well endowed with solar, wind and biomass sources of energy.\nWhere we have lagged, unfortunately, is in our ability to develop and to create technological solutions for harnessing these resources.\nOne particular trajectory for carrying out stringent mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions assessed by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) clearly shows the need for ensuring that global emissions of greenhouse gases peak no later than 2015 and reduce rapidly thereafer.\nThe cost associated with such a trajectory is truly modest\" and would amount, in the estimation of IPCC, to not more than 3 percent of the global GDP in 2030. In other words, the level of prosperity that the world have reached without mitigation would at worst be postponed by a few months or a year at the most.\nThis is clearly not a very high price to pay for protecting hundreds of millions of people from the worst risks associated with climate change.\nAny such effort, however, would require lifestyles to change appropriately also.\nMitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is not a mere technological fix, and clearly requires changes in lifestyles and transformation of a country's economic structure, whereby effective reduction in emissions is brought about, such as through the consumption of much lower quantities of animal protein.\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has determined that the emissions from the livestock sector amount to 18 percent of the total.\nThe reduction of emissions from this source is entirely in the hands of human beings, who have never questioned the impacts that their dietary habits of consuming more and more animal protein are bringing about.\nMitigation overall has huge co-benefits, such as lower air pollution and health benefits, higher energy security and greater employment.",

    "passage": "Passage - 2\nNet profits are only 2.$2\\%$ of their total assets for central public sector undertakings, lower than for the private corporate sector.\nWhile the public sector or the State- led entrepreneurship played an important role in triggering India's industrialization, our evolving development needs, comparatively less-than- satisfactory performance of the public sector enterprises, the maturing of our private sector, a much larger social base now available for expanding entrepreneurship and the growing institutional capabilities to enforce competition policies would suggest that the time has come to review the role of public sector.\nWhat should the portfolio composition of the government be? It should remain static all times.\nThe airline industry works well as a purely private affair.\nAt the opposite end, rural roads, whose sparse traffic makes tolling unviable, have to be on the balance-sheet of the State.\nIf the government did not own rural roads, they would not exist.\nSimilarly, public health capital in our towns and cities will need to come from the public sector.\nEqually, preservation and improvement of forest cover will have to be a new priority for the public sector assets.\nTake the example of steel.\nWith near-zero tariffs, India is a globally competitive market for the metal.\nIndian firms export steel into the global market which demonstrates there is no gap in technology.\nIndian companies are buying up global steel companies, which shows there is no gap in capital availability.\nUnder these conditions, private ownership works best.\nPrivate ownership is clearly desirable in regulated industries, ranging from, finance to infrastructure, where a government agency performs the function of regulation and multiple competing firms are located in the private sector.\nHere, the simple and clean solution - government as the umpire and the private sector as the players is what works best.\nIn many of these industries, we have a legacy of government ownership, where productivity tends to be lower, fear of bankruptcy is absent, and the risk of asking for money from the tax payer is ever present.\nThere is also the conflict of interest between government as an owner and as the regulator.\nThe formulation and implementation of competition policy will be more vigorous and fair if government companies are out of action.",
